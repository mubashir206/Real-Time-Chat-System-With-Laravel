4. Pusher Integration
The system uses Pusher for real-time communication.
Why Pusher?


Simple and reliable real-time messaging


Provides typing, seen/unseen, and message delivery events


How It Works:


When a user sends a message, an event is triggered in Laravel.


The event is published to Pusher channels.


All connected clients subscribed to that channel instantly receive the new message.


Typing indicators and seen/unseen status are also updated instantly.



5. Access Control & Security
Only authenticated users can access the chat system.


Role-based access control ensures


Pusher channels are configured with authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

8. Default Admin & User Passwords (Seeder)
To make the system easy to set up and test, an AdminUserSeeder has been created.
When you run the seeder, it automatically creates a default Admin account:


Email: admin@gmail.com


Password: 12345678


Whenever an Admin creates a new normal user through the platform, that userâ€™s default password will also be set to:


Password: 12345678
